# PyTorch-Tutorial
I will be adding tutorials for deep learning using PyTorch in this repository. I am aiming to cover concepts of:

* Linear Regression + Logistic Regression
* Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)
* Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
* Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
* Long Short-Term Memorys (LSTMs)
* Restricted Boltzman Machines (RBMs)
* Autoencoders (AEs)
